We may also employ third-party services to collect this data. The pages you view, the links you click, whether you read emails or click the links inside of them, whether you access the Website from various devices, and other behaviors are all examples of the information we get about how you use our Website. To analyze website traffic and usage trends and learn more about our users' demographics, we may gather analytics data or use third-party analytics tools like Google Analytics.</p>
                <h2 class="mt-5">Retention</h2>
                <p>Shakarzahi LLC will only keep your personal information as long as it's required to complete the task(s) for which it was originally gathered, including to meet any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
                <h2 class="mt-5">Legal Disclaimer</h2>
                <p>We reserve the right to reveal Personal Information where required by law when doing so is necessary to uphold our legal rights, to comply with a court order or other legal process issued on our Website, or when law enforcement otherwise requests it.</p>
